 Wellbore Logging and Formation Evaluation

This project focuses on the interpretation of well log data to evaluate subsurface formations. The objective is to determine lithology, porosity, and fluid content using key well logs such as gamma ray, resistivity, density, and neutron logs.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Interpret well logs for formation evaluation
- Identify hydrocarbon-bearing zones
- Estimate porosity and fluid saturation
- Support reservoir characterization decisions

---

## 📚 Methods Used

- **Gamma Ray Log** – Used to distinguish between shale and clean formations.
- **Resistivity Log** – Indicates the presence of hydrocarbons vs. water.
- **Density and Neutron Logs** – Combined to evaluate porosity and lithology.
- **Crossplots** – Used to confirm lithological interpretation.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Manual log analysis using plotted data
- Excel or plotting tools (can be adapted to Python)
- Basic petrophysical principles (Archie’s Equation, etc.)
